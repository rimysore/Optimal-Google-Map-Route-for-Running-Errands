# Errand OS: Autonomous Multi-Stop Optimizer 🚀

Errand OS is an AI-powered agentic orchestrator that goes beyond simple GPS. While standard maps calculate the fastest route between points A and B in a fixed order, **Errand OS** re-imagines your entire journey. It understands the *intent* of your errands and uses geospatial intelligence to optimize your path dynamically.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Agentic Re-ordering:** Automatically re-sequences your stops based on proximity and live traffic rather than the order you typed them.
- **Contextual Intelligence:** Identifies errands that share parking lots or are within walking distance (e.g., grouping a Starbucks run with a FedEx drop-off).
- **Live "Vibe" Insights:** Provides data on parking availability and crowd density at each location.
- **Smart Time Estimation:** Calculates a total "Time Investment" for the entire mission, including stop durations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React + Vite
- **AI Orchestration:** Gemini 1.5 Flash API
- **Geospatial Data:** Google Maps Platform (Places API, Distance Matrix API, Routes API)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (High-fidelity Dark Mode UI)

## 🧠 Why Errand OS?
Traditional navigation apps are reactive—they wait for you to tell them exactly where to go and in what order. Errand OS is **proactive**. By utilizing the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** mindset, the agent parses your natural language input (e.g., "I need to get coffee and drop off a package"), identifies the best specific locations, and builds an optimized mission plan.
